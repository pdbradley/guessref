# Guessref

This project is an experiment so I can learn React, play with graphql subscriptions and the Hasura graphql engine,
practice using Storybook to prototype front end components, and play with the Bulma CSS framework.

A lot to chew on! Also if this game works, it will be a nice way to learn the references of many Bible verses.

## Getting Started:

1. clone project
2. docker-compose up (should spin up four containers--postgres, rails, node, hasura)
3. go to localhost:3000
