# dattach <docker container name>
# usage:

# bin/dattach <container name>
#
# if docker ps shows a container with the name "rails" in it, this will attach
# to the console in that running container

# note that if you have two containers that can both match the <container name> substring
# results are unpredictable

docker attach $( docker ps | grep $1 | awk "{print \$1}" | head -n 1 )
